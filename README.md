# **Data Analysis project - Credit Risk assessment and multivariate analysis**

## Project Description

This project focuses on **Credit Risk Assessment** in the banking sector using **Power BI dashboards**.  
The objective is to analyze client and banking data to minimize lending risks and support decision-making for loan approvals.  

Key steps include:  
- **Data Cleaning**: Created new columns (Engagement Timeframe, Engagement Days, Income Bands, Processing Fees).  
- **Calculated Metrics**: Implemented DAX functions like `SUM`, `SUMX`, `DISTINCTCOUNT`, `SWITCH`, and `DATEDIFF`.  
- **KPIs Developed**: Total Clients, Total Loan, Bank Loan, Business Lending, Deposits, Fees, and Credit Card Balances.  
- **Visualizations**: Interactive dashboards for Loan Analysis, Deposit Analysis, and a Summary Dashboard.  

The outcome is an **insightful banking operations dashboard** that empowers financial institutions to understand client behavior, track deposits and loans, and strengthen strategies for risk management.
